Privacy Policy for Daily Byte
Thank you for using Daily Byte (the "App"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about the types of data we collect, how we use and store it, and the measures we take to protect your privacy. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Information Collection and Usage

We want to make it clear that Daily Byte does not collect any data from its users. We do not request, store, or access any personal information, including but not limited to names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.

The App operates entirely offline and allows users to input and store information locally on their devices. All data that users provide is stored locally on their phones and is not transmitted or shared with anyone else.

2. User-Provided Data

The App allows users to provide and save data locally on their devices. This data is exclusively stored on the user's phone and remains under the user's control. We do not have access to this data, nor do we collect or synchronize it with any external servers or databases.

3. Security

We take the security of your data seriously. Since the App does not involve any data transmission to external servers or third-party services, the risk of data breach or unauthorized access is significantly reduced. However, we still employ reasonable security measures to protect the App from potential vulnerabilities and ensure the safety of our users' data.

4. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with personal information without their consent, they should contact us at ankityadav120140@gmail.com, and we will take steps to promptly remove such information from our records.

5. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes made to the policy will be reflected in the latest version available in the App store. By continuing to use the App after any updates to this Privacy Policy, you accept the revised terms.

6. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or the practices of Daily Byte, please contact us at ankityadav120140@gmail.com.

Please note that while we take all efforts to protect your data, the use of mobile devices and apps is not entirely risk-free. We encourage you to ensure your device has the latest security updates, use secure access methods (e.g., passcodes, biometric authentication), and be cautious when downloading apps from untrusted sources.

By using Daily Byte, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. Thank you for trusting us with your privacy.
